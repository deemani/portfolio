# **NBA Shot Profile Application**

This directory holds the code and files I used to construct the NBA Shot Profile application hosted at **https://deepakmani.shinyapps.io/nba_shot_locations/**.

This application is a live dashboard that provides users with a shooting profile of each NBA player's regular season field goal attempts from 2008 - 2018. 
The dashboard takes user input for Player Name and Season Year and auto-produces:
- **(1) a treemap of a given player's field goal percentage and total field goal attempts from each area of the court.**
- **(2) a summary table of field goal attempts broken down by 2 point vs 3 point shots.**
- **(3) a summary table of the information provided in the treemap with ordering options for closer analysis.**

The directory **portfolio/nba_shot_loc** holds the initial shooting data file and the R file of my data cleaning, analysis, and initial build attempts for the application.

The directory **portfolio/nba_shot_loc/nba_shot_location_app** holds the app.R file used to produce the app, along with the csv file of data the application uses.

Enjoy!
