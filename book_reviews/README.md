## Data Cleaning & Functions
The raw data used for generating book recommendations is not hosted in the repository due to its large size. However, the process of cleaning and preprocessing the raw data is documented in the books_import.py file within the project. This file contains detailed information on how the raw data was cleaned and formatted for use in the Amazon Book Recommendation Tool.

Additionally, the book_functions.py file contains custom functions that were written to facilitate specific processes required for creating the recommendation tool. These functions aid in tasks such as data manipulation, feature extraction, and recommendation algorithm implementation.
