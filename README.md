# World Happiness & Urbanization (Data Exploration)
 * Investigated how urbanization correlates to happiness globally.
    - Initial hypothesis: Countries that urbanized more over the last decade are more likely to report increased happiness.
    - Result: no discernible correlation between happiness and increased urbanization over last decade

    - Interesting points:
        - China’s and India’s different paths
            - Both nations saw an increase in urbanization but diverged in happiness ratings.
            - China saw a large spike in urbanization and happiness. Particularly of note is that China went from below 50% urbanized population at the start of the decade to well above 60%, indicating a mass population cultural shift.
            - Whereas for India, despite significant growth in urbanization, the nation is still mainly rural with less than 40% of the population in urban areas. This split is probably more indicative of a cultural rift, with societal imbalance causing strife.

        - West’s Changes in Urbanization
            - Nations that saw increased in urbanization saw political shifts towards end of decade (ex: France & 2017 Presidential election, UK & 2016 Brexit referendum, USA & 2016 Presidential election). The increased cultural divide between urban and rural populations of each of these nations most likely contributed to political outcomes.
            - Nations that saw low/stable urbanization did not have political upheavals and instead maintained steady political establishment (ex: Merkel & Germany, Trudeau & Canada)
